# How Kubernetes simplifies zero-downtime deployment

When getting started with Kubernetes, one of the first commands
that we learn and use is generally `kubectl run`. Folks who have
experience with Docker tend to compare it to `docker run`, and
think: "Ah, this is how I can simply run a container!"

As it turns out, when one uses Kubernetes, one doesn't simply
run a container.

Let's look at what happens after running a very basic `kubectl run`
command:

```bash
$ kubectl run web --image=nginx
deployment.apps/web created
```

Alright! Then we check what was created on our cluster, and ...

```bash
$ kubectl get all
NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/web-65899c769f-dhtdx   1/1       Running   0          11s

NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   46s

NAME                  DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/web   1         1         1            1           11s

NAME                             DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
replicaset.apps/web-65899c769f   1         1         1         11s
$
```

Instead of getting a *container*, we got a whole zoo of unknown beasts:

- a *deployment* (called `web` in this example),
- a *replicaset* (`web-65899c769f`),
- a *pod* (`web-65899c769f-dhtdx`).

(Note: we can ignore the *service* named `kubernetes` in the example
above; that one already did exist before our `kubectl run` command.)

"I just wanted a container! Why do I get three different objects?"

We are going to explore the roles of these different objects, and
explain how they are essential to zero-downtime deployments in Kubernetes.

This is the kind of situation where at first glance, we wonder
"what's the point of this?", but once we get the full picture,
we will understand the role and purpose of each component.

(In fact, a lot of people end up thinking that if we had been tasked
with designing the system, they would have come up with something quite similar!)


## Containers and pods

In Kubernetes, the smallest unit of deployment is not a container;
it's a *pod*. A pod is just a group of containers (it can be a group
of *one* container) that run on the same machine, and share a few
things together.

For instance, the containers within a pod can communicate with each
other over `localhost`. From a network perspective, all the processes
in these containers are local.

But we can never create a standalone container: the closest we can do
is create a *pod*, with a single container in it.

That's what happens here: when we tell Kubernetes, "create me some
NGINX!", we're really saying, "I would like a pod, in which there
should be a single container, using the `nginx` image."

Alright, then, why don't we just have a pod? Why the replica set and
deployment?


## Declarative and imperative

Kubernetes is a *declarative* system (by opposition to *imperative* systems).
This means that we can't give it *orders*.
We can't say, "run this container." All we can do, is describe
*what we want to have*, and wait for Kubernetes to take action to *reconcile*
what we have, with what we want to have.

In other words, we can say, "I would like a 40-feet long blue container
with yellow doors," and Kubernetes will find such a container for us.
If it doesn't exist, it will build it; if there is already one but it's green
with red doors, it will paint it for us; if there is already a container
of the right size and color, Kubernetes will do nothing, since *what we have*
already matches *what we want*.

In software container terms, we can say, "I would like a pod named `web`,
in which there should be a single container, that will run the `nginx` image."

If that pod doesn't exist yet, Kubernetes will create it. If that pod
already exists and matches our spec, Kubernetes doesn't need to do anything.

With that in mind, how do we scale our `web` application, so that it runs
in multiple containers or pods?


## Pods and replica sets

If all we have is a pod, and we want more identical pods, all we can do
is get back to Kubernetes, and ask it, "I would like a pod named `web2`,
with the following specification: ..." and re-use the same specification
as before. Then repeat as many times as we want to have pods.

This is rather inconvenient, because it is now our job to keep track of
all these pods, and to make sure that they are all in sync and use the
same specification.

To make things simpler, Kubernetes gives us a higher level construct,
the *replica set*. The specification of a replica set looks very much like
the specification of a pod, except that it carries a number, indicating how
many replicas (pods with that particular specification) we want.

So we tell Kubernetes, "I would like a replica set named `web`, which
should have 3 pods, all matching the following specification: ..." and
Kubernetes will accordingly make sure that there are exactly 3 matching pods.
If we start from scratch, the 3 pods will be created. If we already have 3 pods,
nothing is done, because *what we have* already matches *what we want*.

Replica sets are particularly relevant for scaling and high availability.

For scaling, because we can update an existing replica set to change the
desired number of replicas. As a consequence, Kubernetes will create or
delete pods, so that there ends up being exactly the desired number.

For high availability, because Kubernetes will continuously monitor
what's going on on the cluster, and it will ensure that no matter what happens,
we still have the desired number. If a node goes down, taking one of the `web` pods
with it, Kubernetes creates another pod to replace it. If it turns out that the
node wasn't down, but merely unreachable or unresponsive for a while, when it
comes back, we may have one extra pod. Kubernetes will then terminate a pod to make
sure that we still have exactly the requested number.

What happens, however, if we want to change the definition of the *pod*
within our replica set? For instance, if we want to switch the image that we
are using?

Remember: the mission of the replica set is, "make sure that there are N pods
matching this specification." What happens if we change that definition?
Suddenly, there are zero pods matching the new specification.
As a result, Kubernetes immediately creates N pods matching that new specification.
The old pods just stay around, and will remain until we clean them up manually.

It would be nice if these pods could be removed cleanly; and if the creation
of new pods could happen in a more gradual manner.


## Replica sets and deployments

This is exactly the role of *deployments*. At a first glance, the specification
for a deployment looks very much like the one for a replica set: it features
a pod specification, and a number of replicas. (And a few additional parameters
that we will discuss a bit later!)

Deployments, however, don't create (or delete) pods directly.
They delegate that work to one ore more replica sets.

When we create a deployment, it creates a replica set, using the exact
pod specification that we gave it.

When we update a deployment and adjust the number of replicas, it
passes that update down to the replica set.

Things get interesting when we need to update the pod specification itself.
For instance, we might want to change the image to use (because we're
releasing a new version), or the application's parameters (through
command-line arguments, environment variables, or configuration files).

When we update the pod specification, the deployment creates
a *new* replica set with the updated pod specification.
That replica set has an intial size of zero.
Then, the size of that replica set is progressively increased,
while decreasing the size of the other replica set. We could imagine that
we have a sound mixing board in front of us, and we are going to fade in
(turn up the volume) on the new replica set, while we fade out (turn down
the volume) on the old one.

During the whole process, requests are sent to pods of both the old and new
replica sets, without any downtime for our users.

That's the big picture, but there are many little details that make
this process even more robust.


## Broken deployments and readiness probes

If we roll out a broken version, it could bring the entire application down
(one pod at a time!), as Kubernetes will steadily replace our old pods
with the new (broken) version, one at a time.

Unless we use *readiness probes*.

A readiness probe is a test that we add to a container specification.
It's a binary test, that can only say "IT WORKS" or "IT DOESN'T," and
will get executed at regular intervals. (By default, every 10 seconds.)

Kubernetes uses the result of that test to know if the container (and the
pod that it's a part of) is ready to receive traffic. When we roll out
a new version, Kubernetes will wait for the new pod to mark itself as
"ready" before moving on to the next one.

If a pod never reaches the ready state (because the readiness probe keeps
failing), Kubernetes will never move on to the next. The deployment stops,
and our application keeps running with the old version until we address
the issue.

Note: if there is *no* readiness probe, then the container is
considered as ready, as long as it could be started. So make sure
that you define a readiness probe if you want to leverage that feature!


## Rollbacks

At any point in time, during the rolling update or even later, we
can tell Kubernetes: "Hey, I changed my mind; please go back to the
previous version of that deployment." It will immediately switch
the roles of the "old" and "new" replica sets. From that point, it
will increase the size of the old replica set (up to the nominal
size of the deployment), while decreasing the size of the other one.

Generally speaking, this is not limited to two "old" and "new"
replica sets. Under the hood, there is one replica set that is
considered "up-to-date" and that we can think of as the "target"
replica set. That's the one that we're trying to move to; that's
the one that Kubernetes will progressively scale up. Simultaneously,
there can be any number of other replica sets, corresponding to older versions.

As an example, we might run version 1 of an application over 10
replicas. Then we start rolling out version 2. At some point, we
might have 7 pods running version 1, and 3 pods running version 2.
We might then decide to release version 3 without waiting for
version 2 to be fully deployed (because it fixes an issue that we
hadn't noticed earlier). And while version 3 is being deployed,
we might decide, after all, to go back to version 1. Kubernetes
will merely adjust the sizes of the replica sets (corresponding
to versions 1, 2, and 3 of the application) accordingly.


## MaxSurge and MaxUnavailable

Kubernetes doesn't exactly update our deployment one pod at a time.
Earlier, we said that deployments had "a few extra parameters": these
parameters include *MaxSurge* and *MaxUnavailable*, and they
indicate the pace at which the update should proceed.

We could imagine two strategies when rolling out new versions.
We could be very conservative about our application availability,
and decide to start new pods *before* shutting down old ones.
Only after a new pod is up, running, and ready, we can terminate an old one.

This, however, implies that we have some spare capacity available on
our cluster. It might be the case that we can't afford to run any
extra pod, because our cluster is full to the brim, and that we
prefer to shutdown an old pod before starting a new one.

*MaxSurge* indicates how many extra pods we are willing to run
during a rolling update, while *MaxUnavailable* indicates how many
pods we can lose during the rolling update. Both parameters
are specific to a deployment (in other words, each deployment can
have different values for them). Both parameters can be expressed
as an absolute number of pods, or as a percentage of the deployment
size; and both parameters can be zero (but not at the same time).

Let's see a few typical values for MaxSurge and MaxUnavailable,
and what they mean.

Setting MaxUnavailable to 0 means, "do not shutdown any old pod
before a new one is up and ready to serve traffic."

Setting MaxSurge to 100% means, "immediately start all the new
pods" (implying that we have enough spare capacity on our cluster,
and that we want to go as fast as possible).

In Kubernetes 1.12, the default values for both parameters are 25%,
meaning that when updating a deployment of size 100, 25 new pods
are immediately created, while 25 old pods are shutdown. Each time
a new pod comes up (and is marked ready), another old pod can
be shutdown. Each time an old pod has completed its shutdown
(and its resources have been freed), another new pod can be created.


## Demo time!

It is easy to see these parameters in action. We don't need to
write custom YAML, define readiness probes, or anything like that.

All we have to do is to tell a deployment to use an invalid
image; for instance an image that doesn't exist. The containers
will never be able to come up, and Kubernetes will never mark
them as "ready."

If you have a Kubernetes cluster (a one-node cluster like
minikube or Docker Desktop is fine), you can run the following commands
in different terminals to watch what is going to happen:

- `kubectl get pods -w`
- `kubectl get replicasets -w`
- `kubectl get deployments -w`
- `kubectl get events -w`

Then, create, scale, and update a deployment with the following commands:

```bash
kubectl run deployment web --image=nginx
kubectl scale deployment web --replicas=10
kubectl set image deployment web nginx=that-image-does-not-exist
```

We see that the deployment is stuck, but 80% of the application's capacity
is still available.

If we run `kubectl rollout undo deployment web`, Kubernetes will
go back to the initial version (running the `nginx` image).


## Selectors and labels

It turns out that when we said earlier, "the job of a replica set
is to make sure that there are exactly N pods matching the right
specification", that's not exactly what's going on.
Actually, the replica set doesn't look at
the pods' specifications, but only at their labels. In other words, it
doesn't matter if the pods are running `nginx` or `redis` or whatever;
all that matters is that they have the right labels. (In our examples
above, these labels would look like `run=web` and `pod-template-hash=xxxyyyzzz`.)

A replica set as a *selector*, which is a logical expression
that "selects" (just like a `SELECT` query in SQL) a number of pods.
The replica set makes sure that there is the right number of pods,
creating or deleting pods if necessary; but it doesn't change
existing pods.

Just in case you're wondering: yes, it is absolutely possible to manually
create pods with these labels, but running a different image (or with
different settings), and fool our replica set.

At first, this could sound like a big potential problem. In practice,
though, it is very unlikely that we would accidentally pick
the "right" (or "wrong", depending on the perspective) labels,
because they involve a hash function on the pod's specification
that is all but random.

Selectors are also used by *services*, which act as the load balancers
for Kubernetes traffic, internal and external. We can create a service
for the `web` deployment with the following command:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment web --port=80
```

The service will have its own internal IP address
(denoted by the name `ClusterIP`),
and connections to this IP address on port 80 will be load-balanced
across all the pods of this deployment.

In fact, these connections will be load-balanced across all the pods
matching the service's selector. In that case, that selector will be
`run=web`.

When we edit the deployment and trigger a rolling update, a new
replica set is created. This replica set will create pods, whose
labels will include (among others) `run=web`. As such, these pods
will receive connections automatically.

This means that during a rollout, the deployment doesn't reconfigure
or inform the load balancer that pods are started and stopped.
It happens automatically through the *selector* of the service
associated to the load balancer.

(If you're wondering how probes and healthchecks play into this:
a pod is added as a valid *endpoint* for a service only if all its
containers pass their readiness check. In other words, a pod starts
receiving traffic only once it's actually ready for it.)


## Advanced rollout strategies

Sometimes, we want even more control when we roll out a new version.

Two popular techniques which you might have heard about are
*blue/green deployment* and *canary deployment*.

In blue/green deployment, we want to instantly switch over
all the traffic from the old version to the new, instead of doing it
progressively like explained previously. There could be a few
reasons for us to do that, including:

- we don't want a mix of old and new requests, and we want the
  break from one version to the next to be as clean as possible;
- we are updating multiple components (say, web frontend and API
  backend) together, and we don't want the new version of the
  web frontend to talk to the old version of the API backend or
  vice versa;
- if something goes wrong, we want the ability to revert as fast
  as possible, without even waiting for the old set of containers
  to restart.

We can achieve blue/green deployment by creating multiple
deployments (in the Kubernetes sense), and then switching from
one to another by changing the *selector* of our service.

This is easier than it sounds!

The following commands will create two deployments `blue` and
`green`, respectively using the `nginx` and `httpd` container
images:

```bash
kubectl create deployment blue --image=nginx
kubectl create deployment green --image=httpd
```

Then, we create a service called `web`, which initially won't
send traffic anywhere:

```bash
kubectl create service clusterip web --tcp=80
```

Now, we can update the selector of service `web` by
running `kubectl edit service web`. This will retrieve the
definition of service `web` from the Kubernetes API, and open
it in a text editor. Look for the section that says:

```yaml
selector:
  app: web
```

... and replace `web` with `blue` or `green`, to your liking.
Save and exit. `kubectl` will push our updated definition back
to the Kubernetes API, and voilà! Service `web` is now sending
traffic to the corresponding deployment.

(You can verify for yourself by retrieving the IP address of
that service with `kubectl get svc web` and connecting to that
IP address with `curl`.)

The modification that we did with a text editor can also be
done entirely from the command line, using (for instance)
`kubectl patch` as follows:

```bash
kubectl patch service web -p '{"spec": {"selector": {"app": "green"}}}'
```

The advantage of blue/green deployment is that the traffic
switch is almost intantaneous, and we can roll back to the
previous version just as fast, by updating the service
definition again.


## Canary deployment

*Canary deployment* alludes to the canaries that were used in
coal mines, to detect dangerous concentrations of toxic gas like
carbon monoxide. The miners would carry a canary in a cage.
Canaries are more sensitive to toxic gas than humans.
If the canary passed out, it meant that the miners had reached
a dangerous area and should head back before *they* would pass out too.

How does that map to software deployment?

Sometimes, we can't or won't afford to affect all our users
with a flawed version, even for a brief period of time. So instead,
we do a partial rollout of the new version. For instance, we deploy
a couple of replicas running the new version; or we send 1% of our
users to that new version.

Then, we compare metrics between the current version and the canary
that we just deployed. If the metrics are similar, we can proceed.
If latency, error rates, or anything else looks wrong, we roll back.

This technique, which would be fairly involved to set up, ends up
being relatively straightforward thanks to Kubernetes' native
mechanisms of labels and selectors.

It's worth noting that in the previous example, we changed
the service's selector, but it is also possible to change the pods'
labels.

For instance, is a service's selector is set to look for pods
with the label `status=enabled`, we can apply such a label
to a specific pod with:

```bash
kubectl label pod fronted-aabbccdd-xyz status=enabled
```

We can apply labels *en masse* as well, for instance:

```bash
kubectl label pods -l app=blue,version=v1.5 status=enabled
```

And we can remove them just as easily:

```bash
kubectl label pods -l app=blue,version=v1.4 status-
```


## Conclusions

We saw a few techniques that can be used to deploy with more
confidence. Some of these techniques simply reduce the downtime
caused by the deployment itself, meaning that we can deploy
more often, without being afraid of affecting our users.
Some of these techniques give us a safety belt, preventing
a bad version from taking down our service. And some others
give us an extra peace of mind, like hitting the "SAVE" button
in a video game before trying a particularly difficult sequence,
knowing that if something goes wrong, we can always go back where
we were.

Kubernetes makes it possible for developers and operation teams
to leverage these techniques, which leads to safer deployments.
If the risk associated with deployments is lower, it means that
we can deploy more often, incrementally, and see more easily
the results of our changes as we implement them; instead of
deploying once a week or month, for instance.

The end result is a higher development velocity, lower time-to-market
for fixes and new features, as well as better availability of our
applications. Which was the whole point of implementing containers
in the first place.
