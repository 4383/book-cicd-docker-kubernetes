### Who Is This Book For, and What Does It Cover?

The main goal of this book is to provide a practical roadmap to continuous delivery for software development teams who want to use Docker containers to package their code and Kubernetes to run it.

We don't spend much time explaining why you should, or should not use container technologies to ship your applications. We also don't provide a general reference to using Docker and Kubernetes. When you encounter a concept of Docker or Kubernetes that you're not familiar with, we recommend that you consult the official documentation.

We assume that you're fairly new to the container technology stack, and that your goal is to establish a standardized and fully automated build, test and release process.

We believe that both technology leaders and individual contributors will benefit from reading this book.

If you are a CTO or otherwise ultimately responsible for delivering working software to customers, this book will provide you with a clear vision of what a reliable CI/CD pipeline to Kubernetes looks like, and what it takes to build one.

If you are a developer or systems administrator, besides understanding the big picture, you will also find working code and configuration that you can reuse in your own projects.

Chapter 1, "Using Docker for Development and CI/CD", outlines the key benefits of using Docker and provides a detailed roadmap to adopting it.

Chapter 2, "Deploying to Kubernetes", explains what you need to know about Kubernetes deployments to deliver your containers to production.

Chapter 3, "Best Practices for Cloud Native Applications", describes how both our culture and tools related to software delivery need to change in order to fully benefit from the agility that containers and cloud can offer.

Chapter 4, "A Complete CI/CD Pipeline", is a step-by-step guide to implementing a CI/CD pipeline with Semaphore that builds, tests and deploys a Dockerized microservice to Kubernetes.

## Give Us Feedback

We would very much love to hear your feedback after reading this book. What did you like and learn? What could be improved? Is there something we could explain further?

A benefit of publishing an ebook is that we can continuously improve it. And that's exactly what we intend to do based on your feedback.

This book is open source and source files are hosted on TODO. You can send us feedback by opening an issue on the Git repository, or by sending an email to learn@semaphoreci.com.

## About the Authors

**Marko Anastasov** is a software engineer, author and entrepreneur. Marko co-founded Rendered Text, a software company behind the Semaphore CI/CD service. He worked on building and scaling Semaphore from an idea to a cloud-based platform used by some of the world's engineering teams. He writes about architectures, practices and tools that support continuous delivery on https://semaphoreci.com/blog. Follow Marko on Twitter at @markoa.

**Jérôme Petazzoni** was part of the team that built, scaled, and operated the dotCloud PAAS, before that company became Docker. He worked seven years at the container startup, where he wore countless hats and ran containers in production before it was cool. He loves to share what he knows, which led him to give hundreds of talks and demos on containers, Docker, and Kubernetes. He has trained thousands of people to deploy their apps in confidence on these platforms, and continues to do so as an independent consultant. He values diversity, and strives to be a good ally, or at least a decent social justice sidekick. He also collects musical instruments and can arguably play the theme of Zelda on a dozen of them.

**Pablo Tomas Fernandez Zavalia** is an electronic engineer and writer. He started his career in developing for the City of Buenos Aires City Hall (buenosaires.gob.ar). After graduating, he joined British Telecom as head of the Web Services department in Argentina. He then worked on IBM as a database administrator, where he also did tutoring, DevOps, and cloud migrations. In his free time he enjoys writing, sailing and board games.
