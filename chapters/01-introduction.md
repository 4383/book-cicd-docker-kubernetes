### Who Is This Book For, and What Does It Cover?

The main goal of this book is to provide a practical roadmap to continuous delivery for software development teams who have decided to use Docker containers to package their code and Kubernetes to run it.

We don't spend much time explaining why you should, or should not use container technologies to ship your applications. We also can't provide a better general reference to using Docker and Kubernetes than their respective official documentation.

We assume that you're fairly new to the container technology stack, and that your goal is to establish a standardized and fully automated build, test and release process.

We believe that both technology leaders and individual contributors will benefit from reading this book.

If you are a CTO or otherwise ultimately responsible for delivering working software to customers, this book will provide you with a clear vision of what a reliable CI/CD pipeline to Kubernetes looks like, and what it takes to build one.

If you are a developer or systems administrator, besides understanding the big picture, you will also find working code and configuration that you can reuse in your own projects.

TODO: Summary of each chapter. One paragraph, or sentence, for each.

Chapter 1, "Using Docker for Development and CI/CD", outlines the key benefits of using Docker and provides a detailed roadmap to adopting it.
